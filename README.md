50 Days of Verilog is a challenge for myself to keep practicing Verilog to have a fundamental grasp of VLSI Concepts and practices.

Day 1: 4x4 Signed Multiplier using Gate Level Modelling helps us to look into the fundamental structure of a Hardware Setup of a Signed Multiplier. 

Day 2: FSM Emulation using my college registration number: "22BEC0130". FSM's are easy to make and fun to work with, Using different inputs, we have the ability to track the progress of the FSM, and this task helps us gain insights on sequential circuits.

Day 3: Utilizing FSM's have never been this easy. A perfect example of that is a Traffic Light COntroller using time as a control signal. 

Day 4: I forgot to upload this yesterday but here is a basic implementation of Stack Memory using Verilog

Day 5: A Johnson Counter is a fun counter where the inverted output of the last flip-flop is fed back to the input of the first flip-flop.
